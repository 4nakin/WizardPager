Wizard Pager
=================

Wizard Pager is a library that provides an example implementation of a Wizard UI on Android, it's based of Roman Nurik's wizard pager (https://code.google.com/p/romannurik-code/source/browse/misc/wizardpager)

I've updated Roman's code to use the latest support library, it is now structured as a library project, and it's backwards compatible with Android 2.2
